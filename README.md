Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the factors influencing house prices in the residential real estate market. 
Using advanced data analytics and visualization techniques, we will identify key variables, uncover patterns and trends, and provide insights to inform business decisions and optimize property pricing.

Analysis Objectives
Identify key variables affecting house prices
Unravel interdependencies between variables using advanced statistical methods and visualizations
Discern hidden patterns and outliers impacting pricing strategy
Empower the real estate company with a deeper understanding of market forces
Inform pricing strategy, property acquisition, sales, and negotiation decisions
Uncover opportunities for optimizing property values, enhancing customer satisfaction, and gaining a competitive edge

Objective for property  price prediction  project 
1. Loading the Data:
●	Task: Load the real estate pricing dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
●	Python Library: Pandas
●	Explanation: Load the dataset provided in a CSV or Excel format into a Pandas DataFrame to facilitate easy manipulation and analysis.
2. Cleaning the Data:
●	Task: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any anomalies.
●	Python Library: Pandas
●	Explanation: Ensure data quality by eliminating missing values, removing duplicate entries, and addressing any anomalies or inconsistencies in the dataset.
3. Univariate Analysis:
●	Task: Explore individual variables to understand their distributions and characteristics.
●	Python Library: Matplotlib, Seaborn
●	Explanation: Conduct a univariate analysis to understand the distribution of key variables like house prices. Utilize histograms, kernel density plots, or other visualizations to gain insights into the data.

4. Multivariate Analysis:
●	Investigate relationships between multiple variables, especially those impacting house prices.
●	Python Library: Matplotlib, Seaborn
●	Explanation: Perform multivariate analysis to understand the correlations and dependencies between various features. Utilize techniques like correlation matrices or scatterplot matrices for a comprehensive view.
 
Handling outlier 
 Removing outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method involves identifying data points that fall below the first quartile (Q1) minus 1.5 times the IQR or above the third quartile (Q3) plus 1.5 times the IQR and then removing them from the dataset. This method helps in eliminating extreme values that might skew the analysis or modeling process.
•  Handling Ordinal and Nominal Columns: Using metadata provided, the project aims to identify ordinal and nominal columns separately to appropriately handle them in property price prediction models
•  Encoding Techniques for Ordinal and Nominal Variables: Based on model requirements, the project will determine the proper encoding technique for ordinal and nominal variables to ensure optimal performance in property price prediction models.

Feature Engineering:
●	Create new features that capture relevant information for pricing analysis.
●	Python Library: Pandas
●	Explanation: Introduce new variables that might enhance the model's ability to predict house prices. For instance, calculate the price per square foot or engineer a feature representing the property's age.
●	Machine Learning Model Development: The project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting property prices based on selected variables, leveraging insights gained from EDA and appropriate encoding techniques.
●	Model Evaluation and Comparison: The performance of the developed model will be evaluated and compared with other machine learning algorithms to assess its effectiveness in predicting property prices accurately.
